As part of this team, you work with many kinds of creative thinkers all tasked with ensuring creative excellence across the Google Marketing landscape. Your goal is to deliver one integrated Google brand experience, and to better define the Google Marketing way. By embracing user insights, strategic thinking, and beautiful design paired with provocative execution, you strive to create delightfully intuitive (and delightfully inventive!) experiences that will define the future of our brand.', u'The creative team at Google Brand Studio is a multidisciplinary team composed of art directors, designers, writers, UXers, IAists, animators, editors and filmmakers. We define and extend the Google brand, and put Google?s values into action through brand campaigns, films and digital and physical experiences.

You will be developing, defining and stewarding the implementation of the Google brand across all mediums, working with key stakeholders and design visionaries from across the company to build consensus and brand cohesion across marketing, product, and physical spaces. You know how to translate intent into a brand identity system, and you will be a key contributor to Google's brand execution across marketing, communication, physical, and media touch points. You are a long-term brand steward ? a leader who is naturally wired as a problem-solver who can rally a diverse team, collaborate with and inspire other Google thought leaders, internal creatives and external partners. A love of technology and a belief in its potential to improve people?s lives is essential, but so is a healthy skepticism for the way tech brands typically talk about themselves and their products. Passion and understanding brand communication on a large scale will be a key to success within this role.\", u\"Know the user. Know the magic. Connect the two. At its core, marketing at Google starts with technology and ends with the user, bringing both together in unconventional ways. Our job is to demonstrate how Google's products solve the world's problems--from the everyday to the epic, from the mundane to the monumental. And we approach marketing in a way that only Google can--changing the game, redefining the medium, making the user the priority, and ultimately, letting the technology speak for itself.\", u'Use two fingers to move the map']\n",
